'''Note''': To avoid confusions with names and references, and also because it's canonically accurate with trailers and the manga, we'll take '''Aether as the Traveler''' and '''Lumine as the Traveler's Twin'''.

==Celestia and the First Civilization==
* ? '''BP''' ''"Once upon a time, the people of the land could hear revelations from Celestia directly.<br />The envoys of the gods walked among benighted humanity then. In those days, life was weak, and the earth was blanketed in unending ice."'' <ref name="PFS">[[Prayers to Springtime]]</ref> '''A long time ago, the people could hear revelations directly from [[Celestia]], and the envoys of the gods would walk among humanity. The earth was completely covered in ice.'''
** ''"Once upon a time, the people of the land could hear revelations from the heavens directly.<br />The envoys of the gods walked among benighted humanity then."'' <ref name="PFI">[[Prayers for Illumination]]</ref> <ref name="PFD">[[Prayers for Destiny]]</ref> <ref name="PFW">[[Prayers for Wisdom]]</ref>
* ? '''BP''' ''"The eternal ice had just begun to thaw, and the first fires were still new."'' <ref name="PFI"/> '''The ice melts and the first fire begins.'''
** ''"It was a time of great prosperity, when all was left in the hands of such heavenly revelations."'' <ref name="PFI"/> Celestia guides humanity with revelations, bringing prosperity.
** ''"The envoys of heaven said that the world would soon enter a new and brighter age.<br />This was predestined, that future immutable."'' <ref name="PFI"/> A new age will come and the future cannot be changed.
*** ''"But would a day come when such wonderful times might come to an end?<br />To this question the envoys gave no answer."'' <ref name="PFI"/> The gods either didn't know or knew but wouldn't want to say it.
*** ''"So, the people chose from among them a chief priest,<br />And adorning his head with a crown of white branches, they sent him out into the deep places of the world,<br />To antediluvian ruins and long-buried altars of sacrifice, to seek answers and enlightenment..."'' <ref name="PFI"/> Since they wanted to know, they chose a chief priest among them, gave him a crown of white branches, and sent him into the deep places of the world to seek the truth.
* ? '''BP''' ''"[...] the ancient flames were extinguished amidst the first falling rains."'' <ref name="PFD"/> '''The fire is extinguished and the first rain comes.'''
** ''"It was a prosperous time, a period of bountiful harvest."'' <ref name="PFD"/> Another prosperous time with bountiful harvest.
** ''"Then the earth was blessed and ruled by heaven, and the elemental flows were smooth and well-ordered."'' <ref name="PFD"/> Celestia blesses and rules over earth, making the elemental flows smooth and well-ordered.
** ''"A hundred years of bounty were written in the stars, and none could change this divine law."'' <ref name="PFD"/> Another revelation by Celestia that cannot be changed.
*** ''"But what of the time after, a hundred, a thousand years from now? Would they have famine where they had plenty, poverty where once were riches?<br />Would their altars and palaces become one with the soil, with only that silver-white tree for company?<br />The heavenly envoys, who ever spoke what they knew, were silent."'' <ref name="PFD"/> The gods, once again, didn't answer the people's concerns about the future, either because they didn't know or they didn't want them to know.
*** ''"So to understand this doom,<br />The chief priest, head crowned with white branches, would delve into the deep places of the world..."'' <ref name="PFD"/> They send the chief priest to seek the truth again.
* ? '''BP''' ''"[...] the waters ran dry as thunder first pierced the skies."'' <ref name="PFW"/> '''The water dries and the first thunder comes.'''
** ''"People enjoyed untold wisdom, and that wisdom was their boon.<br />Their prosperity brought pride and ambition, and the mind to question."'' <ref name="PFW"/> The people now get wisdom, and together with it, pride, ambition, and a mind to question.
** ''"So they questioned the heavens' authority, and schemed to enter the garden of gods.<br />And though they had promised to the people divine love, prosperity and wisdom, the envoys of heaven were angry.<br />For to question eternity was forbidden,<br />For earth to challenge sky, inexpiable."'' <ref name="PFW"/> The people questioned Celestia's authority and tried to enter it. The gods were angry, as it is forbidden to question them and unforgivable to challenge Celestia.
** ''"So the chief priest who wore the white-branched crown went forth to appease the divine envoys,<br />And into the deep places he went, seeking the hidden wisdom of the silver tree in the ancient capitol..."'' <ref name="PFW"/> The chief priest tries to calm down the gods and goes again in search for "hidden wisdom".
*** ''"They say that,<br />The line of chief priests have always seen this same sight as their days draw to an end:<br />A mountain of crowns in a secret place, beneath a withered tree——each one hiding a lifetime of secrets kept.<br />Each retiring chief priest offers up their crown of flawless white branches to this world.<br />Every mighty and ancient city, and every austere place of sacrifice must one day return to profundity in the earth.<br />All prosperity must someday end.<br />But this does not mean that nothing is eternal.<br />At the end of a cycle, the earth shall be renewed. Thus eternity is cyclical.<br />The search for truth is a product of prosperity, and not the seed that plants it."'' <ref name="PFS"/> It seems that the world of ''Genshin Impact'' is in an eternal cycle that Celestia oversees, and makes sure all goes according to their revelations.
* ? '''BP''' ''"Long ago, three bright moons once hung high in the night sky."'' <ref name="MBF">[[Moonlit Bamboo Forest]]</ref> It seems there were three moons in the past instead of one.
** ''"These three moons were sisters, their years numbering more than that of the Geo Archon and their year of birth dating before the very bedrock upon which Liyue Harbor now rests."'' <ref name="MBF"/> They came to be even before the Geo Archon and the earth itself.
** ''"They navigated the heavens above in their silver carriage, alternating with one another thrice a month. If the reign was not promptly passed from one sister to the next, a terrible disaster would occur that very day."'' <ref name="MBF"/> The moons would use a silver carriage to travel, and if they wouldn't exchange place, a terrible disaster would occur.
** ''"These three luminous moons shared but one love, the stars of daybreak. Only at the fleeting moments when day and night converged could one of the three sisters pass the fading stars and gaze upon the chambers of the morning stars. Moments later, as the new dawn would break over the horizon, the carriage would quickly ferry the night’s sister away."'' <ref name="MBF"/> This is how they were exchanging places thrice a month.
** ''"With time, disasters overturned the sovereign carriage and laid ruin to the halls of the stars. The three sisters of the night turned against one another, leading to their eternal parting by death. Only one of their pale corpses now remains, ever shedding its cold light..."'' <ref name="MBF"/> The moon we see in the sky is the corpse of one of the sisters.
** ''"The wolf packs are children of the moons, they remember the calamities and the tragedies that ensued. Hence, they lament the fate of their mother with each new moon... It is also why those who live among the wolves call the morning stars, the surviving love of the moon, the grievous stars."'' <ref name="MBF"/> This could mean that Andrius, and maybe Razor as well, know about the moons and what calamity befell them.
** ''"Or that once there were three bright moons in the night sky named Aria, Sonnet and Canon, sisters who were parted by death in a great catastrophe."'' <ref name="HSD">[[Heart's Desire]]</ref> The three moons' names were Aria, Sonnet, and Canon.
* ? '''BP''' - At some point, there was a kingdom established in the heavens with a king and two heirs. The first heir is tasked to find the Genesis Pearl from the Kingdom of Darkness, but she is deceived and her memory is changed to make her believe she was the queen of the Kingdom of Darkness. The second heir is sent out for the same task, and it is unknown if he succeeded or not. <ref>Story Teaser: Gnostic Chorus (Battle Pass) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0pkwZVL_GQ]</ref>
* '''6000 years BP''' - ''"[...] whereas Rex Lapis was more than six thousand years old at the time of his passing."'' <ref name="STFG">[[Solitary Fragrance]]</ref> '''[[Rex Lapis]] is born.'''

==Liyue is Born==
* '''3700 years BP''' - ''"But I suppose you have yet to experience the substance of Liyue's three thousand and seven hundred years of divinity."'' <ref>[[An Organization Known as Wangsheng]]</ref> ''"This means that Liyue had been under Rex Lapis' rule from the moment it was first founded 3,700 years ago."'' <ref name="STFG"/> '''Rex Lapis establishes [[Liyue]].'''
** ''"According to our records, the adepti signed a contract with Rex Lapis to protect Liyue 3,700 years ago."'' <ref>[[Turning Point]]</ref> Rex Lapis signs a contract with the [[Adepti]] to protect Liyue.
** ''"Guizhong, the Lord of Dust was an ally to the Lord of Geo."'' <ref name="STC1">[[Stone Tablet Compilations (I)]]</ref> [[Guizhong]] and Rex Lapis were allies.
*** ''"She brought her people to the north of Mt. Tianheng and taught them to tend the soil. Agriculture became their livelihood, and all prospered from it. The farming towns stretched for miles, and it was said that one could walk all the way to Stone Gate without ever leaving the network of pathways between the fields."'' <ref name="STC1"/> Guizhong brings her followers north of Mt. Tianheng.
*** ''"Guizhong said to the Lord of Rock: "My people had left their home and came to this place. Here, they are happy in their abodes and content in their work, thus it is as if they have returned home. Hence, what better name to call this place than 'the Plains of the Returning and Departing?'" The Lord of Rock praised the Lord of Dust for her work, and thereafter the area was named in the tongue of Liyue "Guili Plains.""'' <ref name="STC1"/> The place is what we know now as Guili Plains.
**** ''"Records suggest that prior to the Archon War, this area was a thriving marketplace."'' <ref name="TTG">[[Teyvat Travel Guide]]</ref>
** ''"The Geo Archon grew in strength and stature because of the people's belief in him."'' <ref name="RI">[[Rex Incognito]]</ref> It seems that gods grow stronger the more people believe in them.
** ''"Before the Archon War, Dihua Marsh was all dry land and fertile soil. But the war caused landslides and the land was flooded, turning it into the marsh you see now. Nearly all the Glaze Lilies were wiped out."'' <ref name="STFG"/> [[Dihua Marsh]] was a dry and fertile land.
* ? '''BP''' - ''"Legend tells of a lone wolf that roamed a barren wasteland far, far away.<br />Once, he had been king of his pack, leading them in the hunt, in battle, and in the search for a home... Now, the sole remaining legacy of those days were the scars that covered his body."'' <ref name="ADT">[[A Drunkard's Tale]]</ref> There was once a lone wolf who had become a king of a pack of wolves, and then slowly lost all of them through the wasteland they were going through.
** ''"This wasteland is said to be a land beyond the dominion of the deities, inhabited only by the grotesque ghostly remains of fallen gods, where the former palaces of the Seelie now stand empty."'' The wasteland was a land far away from the rule of the gods. It also seems that the Seelie used to have palaces, probably even a city. <ref name="ADT"/>
** ''"So when the solitary old wolf passed by a gray palace and heard the sound of music coming from within, it caught its attention. [...] Finally, he came to an inner room, where he saw a fair maiden strumming at her instrument."'' <ref name="ADT"/> The wolf-king meets a white maiden, probably a Seelie, that sings a song made for humans, but now sings to mourn the Seelie's own fate.

==The Lord of the Tower and the King of the North Wind==
* '''3000 years BP''' - ''"Andrius once declared war upon Decarabian, but failed to even scratch the capital of the Lord of the Tower. If it were not for the song of freedom that shattered the city in an instant, Decarabian's dream would have gone on forever."'' <ref>[[Fragment of Decarabian's Epic]]</ref> ''"It was the era when the Tyrant of the North Wind warred with the Lord of the Tower."'' <ref name="AB">[[Amos' Bow]]</ref> '''The war between the Lord of the Tower, Decarabian, and the King of the North Wind, Andrius, begins.''' <ref name="BOG">[[Biography of Gunnhildr]]</ref>
** ''"In those days, the city called "Mondstadt" was surrounded on all sides by gales impenetrable even to the birds of the air. Their ceaseless howling ground the soil and rock of that city into smooth, flowing dust."'' <ref name="VENTI - STY"/> Decarabian had locked the city of Mondstadt inside of an eternal storm, to protect the city from the outside lands, as they were a frozen wasteland.
*** ''"This land was once a realm of sub-zero blizzards and ice storms filled with razor-sharp ice shards, all at the command of Boreas."'' Lupus Boreas, being another name for Andrius, was the reason why the land was a realm of sub-zero blizzards and ice storms filled with razor-sharp ice shards. <ref>[[Ring of Boreas]]</ref> <ref name="SLB">[[Spirit Locket of Boreas]]</ref>
** ''"The Lord of Wind who lived in his high tower was Decarabian, God of Storms. He squinted from on high at his subjects, who bowed before him in unceasing wind, and, believing them submissive, thought this good.<br />The ruler had believed that he had given his subjects a city free from the bitter cold, and to the end, he believed that they had loved him as he loved them."'' <ref name="VENTI - STY"/> Decarabian believed is was doing the right thing for the people.
*** Decarabian was the Lord of Storms and previous Anemo Archon. <ref name="SPDD">[[Scattered Piece of Decarabian's Dream]]</ref> <ref>[[Debris of Decarabian's City]]</ref>
*** Decarabian's tower is the present-day [[Stormterror's Lair]]. <ref>[[Tile of Decarabian's Tower]]</ref>
*** Another name for Decarabian was "King of Gales". <ref name="TTG"/>
**** ''"I blew up a few arcades so people can climb up the tower more easily. Looks quite good to me. The ruin feels more ancient now."'' <ref name="TTG"/> It seems that the reason why we could easily ascend the tower in Stormterror's Lair was because [[Alice]] blew it up.
** A long time ago, the Kings of Ice and Frost fought engulfing the land of Mondstadt in ice and snow, and they are Decarabian and Andrius. In this period of time, the first wine of Mondstadt was made. <ref name="ADT"/>
*** ''"If we look back through history, we learn that Mondstadt is situated on a land that was once frozen, where the living conditions were harsh and brewing would be virtually impossible."'' <ref>[[Along with Divinity - Prologue]]</ref>
*** ''"Long time ago in the age when the icy winds blew, our forebears brewed this wine in secret, deep within the frozen earth, to give them the strength to keep surviving. The method they used to brew this kind of wine was forgotten when the people's fate took a turn for the better, and their lives became more joyful."'' <ref name="HSD"/>
** The upcoming trilogy of "History of Kings and Clans" will talk about these two Kings on the first section. <ref>[[History of Kings and Clans - Prologue]]</ref>
* ? '''BP''' - At some point there was a Sea God. <ref name="ROJ">[[Records of Jueyun]]</ref>
* ? '''BP''' - ''"Others say it dates back to before the Archon War, when the Salt God roamed free in Liyue."'' The Salt God roams free in Liyue. <ref name="COL">[[Customs of Liyue]]</ref>
* ? '''BP''' - ''"The blade's first and final master was a martial nomad who went by the name Guhua.<br />It is said he was an adeptus. While Guhua lived, bandits dared not act and the wilderness knew peace like that of the city.<br />Allegedly, at the end of his journey he ascended in a purple haze and became a star."'' <ref name="RS">[[Rainslasher]]</ref> At some point there is an adeptus called Guhua.
** ''"One to whom Guhua had shown kindness founded what is now known as the Guhua School in his honor. But no school is destined to last forever."'' Someone establishes what is now known as the Guhua School.

==The Archon War==
* '''2600 years BP''' ''"Around 2,600 years ago, the Archon War had yet to end, and the world had yet to fall under the dominion of The Seven."'' <ref name="VENTI - STY">[[Venti/Story]]</ref> ''"Beneath the spears lie those cast down by Rex Lapis in those days: gods that failed to seize the title of Archon."'' <ref name="EQBM">[[Equilibrium]]</ref> '''The [[Archon War]] had already begun by this time, and it started because the gods wanted to seize the titles of Archon.'''
** ''"As we all know, Teyvat was plunged into chaos two and a half millennia ago when the gods declared war on each other, the ensuing conflict spreading to all people in all corners of the land."'' <ref name="RI"/> 2500 years ago it was still at war.
*** ''"Teyvat may not have been divided into the same seven nations we know today back in that age, but then, just as now, the people had their own settlements, cities and civilizations..."'' <ref name="RI"/> Teyvat was not divided into 7 nations we know now.
** ''"In a barren ancient time, when the now-verdant land was still but a wasteland, a maiden, barefoot in the snow, followed the footsteps of the Lord of the Tower."'' <ref name="AB"/> [[Amos]], a maiden in love with Decarabian, follows him.
*** ''"Awoken from blind love, she realized she was the only one who spoke with sincerity."'' <ref name="AB"/> She realizes that he does not love her the same way she does.
** ''"Gunnhildr’s father, the then-leader of the clan, had once served under Decarabian. He served until he found the despotic rule of the aloof and selfish king to be more than he could bear, whereupon he had led his clan outside of the city where ferocious winds howled without mercy."'' Gunnhildr's father used to serve under Decarabian, but then left the city with his clan. <ref name="BOG"/>
*** ''"Just when all hope seemed to be lost for the wandering clan, a spirit from the midst of the myriad winds heard Gunnhildr’s prayers."'' <ref name="BOG"/> [[Barbatos]], as a wind spirit, hear's the Gunnhildr's prayers.
*** ''"The sincere plea of a clan chief’s young daughter joined with a people’s cry of help, a cry that the blizzard had all but drowned out, and became a faith. The faith gathered in front of the wind spirit like water flowing into a spring and became the source from which the wind spirit drew its power. The wind spirit used this power to make a small shelter for the clan, and bestowed upon the clan chief’s daughter the power to protect."'' <ref name="BOG"/> Barbatos gains his initial powers through faith.
*** ''"After her father’s death, Gunnhildr took his place as the clan’s leader. She also became its first priestess."'' Gunnhildr's father dies and she takes his place as the clan leader and first priestess. <ref name="BOG"/>
*** ''"When the Anemo Archon Barbatos challenged the aloof and selfish king Decarabian’s rule, Gunnhildr led her people to make a stand against the Archon’s fury. But when Barbatos finally fought through the ferocious winds and freed the tyrant’s subjects, she was also the one who decorated the victorious Anemo Archon with laurels."'' Barbatos challenges Decarabian, but it seems that Gunnhildr tries to stop him from doing so, although unsuccessfully. <ref name="BOG"/>
** ''"In those days, Venti was but a single thread of the thousand winds that roared through the northern lands.<br />In Mondstadt of old, Venti met a young boy. This lad knew how to play the lyre, and longed to write the greatest poem of all."'' <ref name="VENTI - STY"/> At the same time, Barbatos, a single, shapeless wisp among the thousand winds, encounters a young boy who lived under Decarabian's rule. <ref name="YT ST:TBW">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_V0TX6MyGw&ab_channel=GenshinImpact Story Teaser: The Boy and the Whirlwind]</ref>
** ''"Then, war broke out in Mondstadt, in the name of freedom.<br />With the feather tucked away in his breast pocket, Venti watched the fall of the eccentric ruler amid the wrack and ruin of revolt together with his friend. [...]<br />Yet, despite the victory, Venti was never able to give that feather to the lad, for that lad had fallen in the battle for the sake of song, sky, and birds, and for the people who, like him, had dwelled within the storm-wall."'' <ref name="VENTI - STY"/> '''After meeting Barbatos and becoming friends, the boy led a revolt against Decarabian, defeating him, destroying the tower, and bringing peace and freedom to the land, but at the cost of the boy's life.''' <ref name="YT ST:TBW"/>
*** ''"At the end of the war, and when the wind of resistance first blew, in the company of a nameless young man, elf, and knight, she scaled the towering spire and challenged the eccentric lord."'' <ref name="AB"/> Amos meets a young man, elf, and knight being respectively the young bard, Barbatos, and a Ragnvindr knight. We do not know if Andrius helped as well, as he despised all humans. <ref name="YT ST:TBW"/>
** ''"With the crumbling of an ancient seat of divinity, a new god was born. The Anemo Archon Barbatos felt power flowing at his fingertips."'' <ref name="VENTI - STY"/> '''Barbatos becomes the new Anemo Archon after Decarabian is defeated.''' <ref name="SPDD"/>
*** ''"The Wolf King, believing itself to despise humans, thought itself unable to envision a happy life for humanity, making it unworthy of becoming the Lord of the Winds of the world. Therefore, it chose to disappear. Yet, in truth, it gazed on the ones the world abandoned ever so gently."'' <ref>[[Boreal Wolf's Nostalgia]]</ref> Andrius could have become the Anemo Archon instead of Barbatos.
**** ''"Andrius' wolf pack is its blessed honor guard, and even the milk teeth of a wolf's cub possess great potential. In the past, the gods had the responsibility to love all people, which made Andrius quite the oddball for only adopting abandoned babies and accepting wanderers."'' <ref>[[Boreal Wolf's Milk Tooth]]</ref> ''"Andrius found humans to be a disappointment, but believed babies to be innocent. If both the wolf pack and the adopted children chose each other, then they become a Lupical, a fated family."'' <ref>[[Boreal Wolf's Cracked Tooth]]</ref> These could be the reasons why Andrius couldn't believe itself to become an Archon, since it would have had the responsibility to love all people, which it couldn't.
**** ''"Even without its physical body and beyond death, Boreas still possesses extraordinary powers."'' <ref>[[Tail of Boreas]]</ref> Andrius dies and becomes a being without a physical body comprised of ice and wind.
**** ''"In its final moments, it finally realized the chilling north wind could only extinguish life, not nurture it; therefore, Boreas let its powers freely flow into the land to protect it and its inhabitants."'' <ref name="SLB"/> Before dying he realizes that the ice and snow were only destroying life, not nurturing it, and decides to dispel it all.
*** ''"His first use of this power was to reconstitute himself in the likeness of that young lad.<br />For only if he wore human shape could he play the lyre that the lad so loved."'' <ref name="VENTI - STY"/> Barbatos takes the form of the boy to honor him and continue to play his lyre. <ref>[[Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land (Quest)|Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land]]</ref>
*** ''"In the very beginning, archon of the winds, Barbatos, scattered the snow, clove the mountains, and sowed the grains, allowing his wandering kin to live off the bounties of this land. The wind archon then imparted his wisdom to the people. They brewed wine, built windmills, and wove the flying wings. He then set aside special festivals to give his people joy after days of hard work. Pleased with what he had achieved, the god then took his lyre and set off for the wilderness..."'' <ref name="MNG - P"/> ''"Plucking its strings, he scattered the ice and snow and split the mountains with a divine wind."'' <ref name="VENTI - STY"/> ''"Barbatos guided the warm monsoons to Mondstadt with his divine powers."'' <ref>[[Along with Divinity - Prologue]]</ref> Barbatos shapes the land of Mondstadt to make it prosperous for his people, and then leaves.
*** ''"Also — the literature says that some ancient thinkers believed the Anemo Archon to have some sort of connection with this god..."'' <ref>[[Ragged Notebook]]</ref> ''"The phrase "time and the wind" seems like it may have something to do with the Anemo Archon..."'' <ref>[[Thick Notebook]]</ref> At some point, the Anemo Archon has some connections with a certain God of Time.
**** ''"On the cliff facing the eastern sea, the ancestors worshiped the masters of Time and Anemo together.<br />The two are intimately related, as expressed in the saying, "Anemo brings stories while Time nurtures them.""'' <ref name="SS">[[Sacrificial Sword]]</ref>
***** ''"Long ago, a war waged between the Lord of Storm and the Great Wolf King of the North. Mondstadt was engulfed in blizzards, and the snow stung like sand.<br />A group who could bear the cold no longer built a shrine high on a clifftop in the east. There, they prayed for divine mercy and protection.<br />The wind blows for a moment, but the ravages of time are constant, unrelenting, and irreversible.<br />A god of the winds may move between the pages of a book, but in the end, the merciless god of time will eat away at them until not a single legible word remains."'' <ref name="SFM">[[Sacrificial Fragments]]</ref> A group of people tries to appease to the God of Time.
***** ''"Yet, time's assault and that of the wind often take their toll the same upon the heart.<br />Perhaps that is why later generations presumed the shrine to have always been to the wind, and the wind alone."'' <ref name="SFM"/> The people forgot that the shrine was to both gods, not only to the wind god.
*** ''"Barbatos, unwilling to become a tyrant, had departed."'' <ref name="VENTI - STY"/> Barbatos leaves, since he didn't want to become a tyrant.
** ''"This sword once belonged to the Imunlaukr clan, a clan of brave and gifted warriors who fought hard and died young.<br />In sacrificial ceremonies, they would enact duels between brave warriors stained black with blood."'' <ref name="SFGS">[[Sacrificial Greatsword]]</ref> There was a clan called Imunlaukr that loved to fight.
*** ''"In the eyes of the Imunlaukr clan, combat existed not for protection, for glory, or for gaining territory.<br />Rather, it was for the amusement of the gods, high up in the heavens, for whom little else could serve to entertain."'' <ref name="SFGS"/> They would fight only to entertain the gods.
*** ''"And yet, as the snow slowly melted and Mondstadt began to take shape, gradually they realized: They had found something to fight for at last."'' <ref name="SFGS"/> It seems that the Imunlaukr joined the Mondstadt people.
** ''"This was an age where people watched their gods clash in bitter battles before their very eyes. Rex Lapis would not establish the currency of the seven nations and cast the first Mora coins for quite some time. So the tribes traded using pieces of ore they would chance across from time to time, with idols made in the likeness of the Geo Lord to ensure price stability."'' <ref name="RI"/> Mora didn't exist yet during the Archon War so people would barter instead.
** ''"It later came to pass that the gods each strove for dominance, which brought catastrophe upon the land. Though the adepti fought to protect the Guili Plains, they could not stop the tide of war, which ravaged the plains and took the life of its ruler, Guizhong."'' <ref name="STC1"/> Rex Lapis and Guizhong fought other gods, but Guizhong died.
*** ''"I fought for Rex Lapis and the city of Liyue during the Archon War."'' <ref name="STFG"/> [[Ganyu]] fought in the Archon War.
** ''"Thereupon, the Lord of Rock Rex Lapis took his people south of Mt. Tianheng. Thus the people departed from the Guili Plains for good, never to return, and it was left to become a wilderness."'' <ref name="STC1"/> Rex Lapis abandons the Guili Plains and takes his people south of Mt. Tianheng.
** ''"The people of Liyue turned to commerce and artisanship for their livelihood, and prospered once more. Those who prospered above the rest joined together, calling themselves the Qixing. Thus was formed the framework around which Liyue Harbor developed. Under the jurisdiction of the Qixing were all the known trades, no business of Liyue took place inside or outside the nation that was not known unto them. The Millelith also took orders from the Qixing, supporting the masses at home and suppressing the monsters at the border. Thus became the nature of Liyue’s governance under Rex Lapis."'' <ref name="STC1"/> Liyue Harbor as we know it is built.
** ''"The gentlest of the gods fell not in battle at the hand of the other gods. She fell at the hand of one of her own people, the people she had loved so dearly."''<br />''"He was the first king of the people, and also the last. He had once loved the God of Salt just as the rest did, but as a mere mortal, he ultimately could not fathom the self-sacrificial love the god embodied. He sought after military might, in the hope that the city might be able to hold its own in defense and attack. And so, to demonstrate that gentleness was a virtue unfit for the times, he took a sword and ended the life of the lone, defenseless god. No sooner had she met her demise than the temple itself collapsed, and the people's city crumbled like salt into the earth."''<br />''"Rumors say that the Salt God's body can still be found somewhere in the depths of the ruins. Though her body has turned to salt, it still maintains her posture from the moment she was struck by the king's sword."'' <ref name="DRA">[[Diary of Roald the Adventurer]]</ref> The Salt God gets killed by one of her followers, and her remains can be found somewhere in [[Sal Terrae]]. <ref name="COL"/>
*** ''"This is salt formed from the residue of an ancient archon's tears— [...]<br />Actually, I do not want for money. But let me see... what's this — it looks like salt? It's about time I went to Sal Terrae to pay my respects again. If it's okay with you, this is all I need in return for the gem."'' The archon in the story is a reference to the Goddess of Salt.
** ''"The whole of Lisha was covered by water at the time of the Archon War, and back then this rocky outcrop was nothing more than a little islet that rose above the water's surface. After peace was restored, the region of Lisha unfurled once more as the tides withdrew, revealing the ancient buildings erected by the early peoples."'' <ref name="DRA"/> The ruins in the [[Lisha]] region ([[Qingxu Pool]], [[Lingju Pass]], [[Dunyu Ruins]]) predate even the Geo Archon's rule over Liyue.
*** ''"What she told me was that these ruins were left behind by an evil god, whose name has been wiped from the record, and its people.
